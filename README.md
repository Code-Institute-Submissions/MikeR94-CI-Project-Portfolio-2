# **_The Astronomy Quiz - Project Portfolio 2 - JavaScript_**

The Astronomy Quiz is a small quiz that allows players to test their knowledge of Astronomy. The quiz consists of 3 different levels for the player to choose from, giving more points for harder difficulties. The quiz has 8 questions for each category and if they manage to answer the question correctly, they will receive points based on the difficulty plus additional points for answering the question as fast as they can. The Astronomy Quiz is a brilliant way to not only test your knowledge but also to learn, as the answer will be shown to the player if they either don't answer in time or answer incorrectly.

# Objective

In my second project, I intend to create a challenging, interactive and fun quiz game for user to test their knowledge on Astronomy. The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript alongside showcasing attention to detail and the importance of thorough testing.

# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype

The design prototype for The Astronomy Quiz was produced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). There are design prototypes for Desktop and Mobile. The reason that the design prototype looks very similar to the finished product is because I've learnt that being able to visually see your design before you spend the time implementing it is a very efficient method when it comes to creating something in software development. Being able to use a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to "drag and drop" elements will save a large amount of time as apposed to trying to design through CSS, therefore before I implemented something, I made sure to design it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) first.<br /><br />

## Site Structure

The Astronomy Quiz is a one-page website which has been designed to look like an application. When a user visits the website, they are instantly greeted on the [Home Page](index.html) and asked to enter a username. The quiz is very linear and clear so that the player is never left confused on how to play or what to do. The quiz also has a hamburger menu which the player can select to navigate to additional pages such as **Home**, **Rules**, **Hiscores** and **Contact**. When the player has finished the quiz, they will be presented with a score and then the option to play again which, if clicked, will take the player back to the [Home Page](index.html).

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts chosen were 'Poppins' for the headings and for the body text however different font-weights and font-sizes were used to give further clarity. They fall back to sans-serif respectively if the Poppins font can't be loaded. 
     *  'Poppins' was chosen for the primarily to give the user an initial welcoming feel. The font-style is very modern and clean and gives a professional and inviting feeling to the website.


 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on a dark navy and light blue. This colour scheme gives off a very outer-space like feel and it compliments the background image.<br /><br />

# Features

The Astronomy Quiz website is set up to be very easy to use and visually appealing for the player. It was designed with user-experience in mind. The player should feel like they are doing an Astronomy Quiz just by the visual theme and feel encouraged to keep playing to try and beat their current hiscore.

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Bar

    * Located at the top of the quiz application and provides the user the ability to navigate back to the home page, enter the menu and turn the game sounds on or off. Whilst the player is currently playing the quiz, additional features show like the time left and the players current score.<br /><br />
